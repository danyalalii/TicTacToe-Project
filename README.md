# TicTacToe-Project
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game with n x n grid, where n is a user-defined size. The project reinforces knowledge of C++ programming, including loops, functions, and conditional statements.

## Project Description
This Game project aims to recreate the classic Tic Tac Tow game using C++. 
### Game Rules
#### Game Grid: 
The game is played on an nXn grid, where &#39;n&#39; is chosen by the players at the beginning of the
game.
#### Players:
There are two players, typically represented as &#39;X&#39; and &#39;O&#39;.
#### Objective:
The objective is to be the first to form a line of n consecutive symbols (&#39;X&#39; or &#39;O&#39;) either
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the grid.
#### Gameplay:
● Players take turns to make their moves.
● Each player selects an empty cell on the grid and marks it with their symbol.
● The game continues until one player wins or there are no empty cells left (a draw).
