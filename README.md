# TicTacToe-Project
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game with n x n grid, where n is a user-defined size. The project reinforces knowledge of C++ programming, including loops, functions, and conditional statements.

## Project Description
This Game project aims to recreate the classic Tic Tac Tow game using C++. 
### Game Rules
#### Game Grid: 
The game is played on an nXn grid, where &#39;n&#39; is chosen by the players at the beginning of the
game.
#### Players:
There are two players, typically represented as &#39;X&#39; and &#39;O&#39;.
#### Objective:
The objective is to be the first to form a line of n consecutive symbols (&#39;X&#39; or &#39;O&#39;) either
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the grid.
#### Gameplay:
● Players take turns to make their moves.

● Each player selects an empty cell on the grid and marks it with their symbol.

● The game continues until one player wins or there are no empty cells left (a draw).
### Project Requirements:
● Implement a mechanism to switch players&#39; turns randomly.

● Maintain a variable to track the current player.

### Assessment
The project can be assessed based on the following criteria:

● Correct implementation of the game rules and logic.

● Proper user interface for displaying the game board and taking user input.

● Robust input validation to prevent invalid moves.

● Efficient code structure with well-documented functions.

● Ability to handle various grid sizes and provide a seamless gaming experience.
